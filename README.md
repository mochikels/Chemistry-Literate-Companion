# Chemistry Literate Companion (ChLiC)
CHEMISTRY LITERATE COMPANION

Our Goal
- The researchers created a mobile application called ChLiC, which stands for Chemistry Literate Companion. The goal of ChLiC is to help students learn General Chemistry 1 in a fun, engaging, and interactive way. The application is coded using Flutter, a cross-platform development framework.

Building and running the code 

- The application should only work on a tablet, specifically the Cherry Mobile Omega Tab Pro. This is because the Department of Education (DepEd) provides this tablet to Grade 12 students at Luis Palad Integrated High School. The researchers have set a scope and limitation that the application will be "TEMPORARILY" available on DepEd tablets for now, as it is still under development.

- The developers of the ChLiC application used video tutorials on Flutter in YouTube to learn how to build the application. They are still learning and improving the application, which is being developed for a research project. The researchers who developed the application are open to suggestions, recommendations, and assistance with coding to further improve the application.

About Developers
- The developers of the ChLiC application are novices with only rudimentary programming skills, which they acquired in their previous Robotics class in Grade 10.
